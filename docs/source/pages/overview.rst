|seismic-graph|_ is a python package that generates plots and analysis from mutational profile data. seismic-graph is built to work with DMS-MaPseq data processed by |SEISMIC-RNA|_. seismic-graph also has a built in converter that can read mutational data processed by ShapeMapper2 or RNA Framework.

We recognize that many users may not have the requisite python skills to use a python package, and for them we have built |SEISMICgraph|_, a webapp that allows users to take advantage of the features of seismic-graph without writing any code.

This documentation covers both **seismic-graph** the python package, and **SEISMICgraph** the webapp.
