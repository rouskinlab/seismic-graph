seismic-graph is a `python package <https://pypi.org/project/seismic-graph/>`_ that generates plots and analysis from mutational profile data. seismic-graph is built to work with DMS-MaPseq data processed by `SEISMIC-RNA <https://pypi.org/project/seismic-rna/>`_. seismic-graph also has a built in converter that can read mutational data processed by ShapeMapper2 or RNA Framework.

We recognize that many users may not have the requisite python skills to use a python package, and for them we have built `SEISMICgraph <https://seismicrna.org/>`_, a webapp that allows users to take advantage of the features of seismic-graph without writing any code.

This documentation covers both seismic-graph the python package, and SEISMICgraph the webapp.
